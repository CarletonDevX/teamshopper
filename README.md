[TeamShopper](http://teamshopper.me) is the better way to shop at Target. It is a mobile-optimized web app that allows you to collaborate on your shopping list with your Facebook friends in real time. The app will then let you choose a nearby Target location, and will show you a store map with the shortest path to collect all the items on your list. Finally, it will split the bill for you via Venmo.
